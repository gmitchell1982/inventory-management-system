# Inventory Management Database System
This is an inventory management database backend for the tracking of unique, non-replenishable, items through the small-scale internet resale and market arbitrage process associated with small online businesses who have outgrown the functionality of spreadsheets.

## Project Description
The original contract was to create a product that filled a very large gap in the market of inventory management software. Most inventory management software available assumes either manufacturing supplies used to create inventory or that a company just restocks varibale amounts of the exact or very similar items. These softwares are not often easy to use by businesses that specialize in the sale or resale of individual unique inventory items (such as online resellers, pawn shops, consignment stores, upcyclers, and others).

The main method of getting around the lack of suitable software for these businesses is often to rely on spreadsheets or pen & paper systems. Both of these options have severe limitations for data-informed business management as well as making both insurance and tax reporting more difficult and less beneficial (example: many business insurance providers want to know the total estimated sale value of all current inventory for coverage adjustments, and there are some potential IRS advantages for being able to leverage corporation-style asset tracking even as a sole-proprietership).

This project is a generalization of the database I designed for that customer during my freelance work.

The original database was built in SQLite to operate on a single device with the vast majority of data input, output, user, and database controls handled through a GAMBAS interface (GAMBAS the programming language, not the food) in a purely Linux environment.

This redo for my portfolio forgoes the vast proprietary interface and seeks to translate a generalization of the database structure to SQL Server in order to highlight my abilities to develop a database from scratch for population by a client company.

When complete, this project will also include a companion database dictionary.
